<h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    <br/>
    <br/>
<p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design,dense plantings,and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries,although they were re-invented in 1870's England,when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <u>English estate gardens</u>.</p>
<br/>
    <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants,with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs,along with some fruit trees.</p>
